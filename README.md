Start of a python app for nonlinear least squares fitting of fluorescence emission data.

Is to unmix linearly combined fluorescence emission spectra in order to resolve energy transfer characteristics.
The initial inspiration for this project is to process csv spreadsheets. Such as those exported by TECAN 
plate readers.
